# Network Traffic Analysis with Wireshark

**Author:** MatÃ­as Ordenes  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Tool used:** Wireshark  
**Objective:** Capture and analyze network traffic in a home environment to identify commonly used protocols, connected devices, and potential security risks.

## 1. Capture Environment

- Main device: Personal computer (Windows/Linux)
- Network: Home Wi-Fi
- Other connected devices: Android phone
- Capture duration: 10 minutes
- Generated traffic: Web browsing (Wikipedia, YouTube), AMD driver update

## 2. Observed Protocols

Filtered traffic by protocol:

- `dns`: domain name resolution (e.g., github.com, microsoft.com)
- `http`: unencrypted traffic (only AMD driver downloads observed)
- `tcp.port == 443`: encrypted HTTPS connections

ðŸ“¸ **[Image 3: HTTP traffic detected â€“ AMD driver request]**

## 3. Plain Text Data Review (HTTP)

Using the `http` filter and "Follow HTTP stream", I reviewed the content of HTTP packets.  
Only AMD driver update traffic was observed; no sensitive data like passwords or form submissions were found.

ðŸ”’ **Conclusion:** Most network traffic used HTTPS, which ensures confidentiality and data protection.

## 4. Connected Devices Analysis

Reviewed `Endpoints > IPv4` and MAC address tables to identify devices in the network.

### Identified devices:

| IP              | MAC Address           | Manufacturer                | Device                 |
|-----------------|------------------------|------------------------------|-------------------------|
| 192.168.0.1     | (Router MAC)           | TP-Link                      | Home router             |
| 192.168.0.103   | 18:C0:4D:62:E2:18      | GIGA-BYTE TECHNOLOGY CO.     | Personal computer       |

No unknown or unauthorized devices were detected.

## 5. External IP Review

External communications were limited to trusted services:
- GitHub
- Microsoft
- AMD

No suspicious IP addresses were found. Checked with [AbuseIPDB](https://abuseipdb.com) and [MAC Vendors](https://macvendors.com).

---

## 6. Conclusions

- The home network behaved as expected.
- No intrusion attempts or malicious connections were found.
- HTTPS encryption effectively protected sensitive data.
- Wireshark proved to be a valuable tool to monitor traffic and understand how real networks work.

---

## 7. Key Learnings

- Wireshark reveals real-time communication between devices on a network.
- DNS and ARP traffic provide visibility into internal network structure.
- Understanding protocol-level behavior helps identify and prevent security risks.
- Even in normal conditions, it's possible to gather meaningful cybersecurity insights.
